        YAML specification. After being read, it will be deleted from the written ``docker compose`` generated
        config file.

        The args list should begin with a list of ``len(*args)-1`` of nested keys. For instance, if a custom attribute
        should be structured like the following example, then ``add_custom_attribute("project", ...)``

        ``default`` is the final argument. If it is unset (i.e. remains ``None``), the attribute will be assumed to be required.
        If set, when parsing, the value will be updated to be ``default`` if it is not set in the ATK config file.

        ``dest`` is the destination name for the variable that's generated from the custom attribute. By default, 
        if ``dest`` is ``None``, the last path element in ``args`` will be used. For instance,
        provided the yaml config above, if ``dest`` isn't provided for the ``user: name`` attribute, it will be
        set to ``'name'``.
