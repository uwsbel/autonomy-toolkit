   CLI command that handles working with the ATK development environment

   Entrypoint for the `dev` command

   This entrypoint provides easy access to the ATK development environment. The dev environment
   leverages containers (think [Docker](https://docker.com)) to allow interoperability across operating systems. Similar to
   `docker compose`, `atk dev` provides configurability through a YAML file that defines how a container should be spun up.
   Further, the configuration is used to build, attach, tear down, and possibly run specific command. The `dev` entrypoint will basically wrap
   the `docker compose` (or any other container system) commands to make it easier to customize the workflow to work best for ATK.

   The `dev` command will search for a file called `atk.yml`. This is a hidden file, and it defines some custom
   configurations for the development environment. It allows users to quickly start and attach to the ATK development environment.

   There are five possible options that can be used using the `dev` subcommand:
   `build`, `up`, `down`, `attach`, and `run`. For example, if you'd like to build the container, you'd run
   the following command:

   ```bash
   atk dev --build
   ```

   If you'd like to build, start the container, then attach to it, run the following command:

   ```bash
   atk dev --build --up --attach
   # OR
   atk dev -b -u -a
   # OR
   atk dev -bua
   ```

   If no arguments are passed, this is equivalent to the following command:

   ```bash
   atk dev
   # === is equivalent to ===
   atk dev --up --attach
   ```

   If desired, pass `--down` to stop the container. Further, if the container exists and changes are
   made to the repository, the container will _not_ be built automatically. To do that, add the
   `--build` argument.
