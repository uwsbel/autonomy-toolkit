   CLI command that handles allows generic handling of an ATK config file for running docker containers

   Entrypoint for the `run` command

   This entrypoint provides easy running of generic docker containers. It's exactly a wrapper of docker compose,
   where the ATK config file is used. This allows `atk` to be used.

   To use this entrypoint, you simply need to run the following:

   ```bash
   atk run
   ```

   It will search for an ATK config file in all parent directories (defaults for looking for `atk.yml`; this can
   be overridden with `--filename`) and then use `docker compose run`. Not many checks are done to ensure the
   file is formatted correctly for `docker compose`, so please refer to any errors output from the command for debugging.
